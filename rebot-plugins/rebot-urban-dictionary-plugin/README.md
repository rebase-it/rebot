# ReBot Urban Dictionary Plugin/Client

Command that searches in the [Urban Dictionary](https://www.urbandictionary.com/) a english slang, for example


```
/urban lol
```

Will return something like this:

```
Definition: The name 'Lol' is an abreviated form of the name '[Laurence]'.

```

If the result is something that you are not expecting, you can increase the number of results:

```
/urban -c 2 lol
``` 

Also, it is possible to retrieve a usage example:
```
/urban -e lol
```
